openSUSE User Agent Extension for Chrome

Based on previous work by Tomas Poplea <tpopela@redhat.com> and
Jan Schwarzrock <pssgcsim@gmail.com>

Simply adds the word "openSUSE" to your User Agent string, so 
your distribution can be distinguished from other Linux users
on the web.

Is disabled on netflix.com and onenote.com.
